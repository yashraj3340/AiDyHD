# Game-Based Intervention for ADHD

This project aims to diagnose individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through a series of interactive games. By utilizing game-based interventions, we aim to provide an engaging and effective method for assessing cognitive abilities and identifying ADHD symptoms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start the project:

1. Navigate to the `webgame_server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd webgame_server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Navigate to the `webgame` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../webgame
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the client:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide a novel approach to diagnosing ADHD by leveraging the engaging nature of games. Traditional diagnostic methods can be tedious and may not fully capture the cognitive challenges faced by individuals with ADHD. By integrating diagnostic assessments into games, we can create a more immersive and accurate evaluation process.

## Games

The following games are utilized in this project:

1. **8 Queens**: A puzzle game where players must place eight queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This game tests logical thinking and spatial awareness.
2. **Tower of Hanoi**: A mathematical puzzle where players must move a stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules. This game challenges spatial reasoning and planning skills.
3. **Memory Matching**: A classic memory card game where players match pairs of cards by remembering their locations on a grid. This game challenges working memory and attention to detail.
4. **1-15 Number Puzzle**: Also known as the sliding puzzle, players rearrange numbered tiles on a grid to form a sequential order. This game promotes problem-solving skills and concentration.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of a more extensive questionnaire to gather detailed information about ADHD symptoms and severity.
- Enhanced scoring system to provide more comprehensive assessments of cognitive abilities.
- Development of additional games targeting specific cognitive domains relevant to ADHD.
